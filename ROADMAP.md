## Key

:white_check_mark: - command done

:white_check_mark: :star: - command done with VS Code specific customization

:warning: - some variations of the command are not supported

:running: - work in progress

:arrow_down: - command is low priority; open an issue (or thumbs up the relevant issue) if you want to see it sooner

## Roadmap

These are the big Vim features, put generally in the order in which we plan to implement them.

## Custom commands

- `gh` - show the hover tooltip.
- `gb` - add an additional cursor at the next place that matches `*`.

## Folding

### Fold methods

The folding method can be set with the 'foldmethod' option. This is currently not possible as we are relying on Code's Fold logic.

### Fold commands

Pretty much everything fold-related is blocked by [this issue](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/1004).

### Fold options

Currently we don't support any fold option and we are following Code configurations.
