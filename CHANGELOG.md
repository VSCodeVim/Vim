# Change Log

## [v0.10.11](https://github.com/vscodevim/vim/tree/v0.10.10) (2018-01-17)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/vscodevim/vim/compare/v0.10.10...v0.10.11)

- BREAKING CHANGE: with v0.10.10 (prior release), the default behaviour of `<C-d>` has changed. This particular key can map to 3 different behaviours: (1) move page half down, (2) remap to `<D-d>` for multi-cursor, or (3) VSCode default behaviour. Depending on what you want, set the `handleKeys` configuration appropriately (note that the `useCtrlKeys` configuration is entirely ignored for this particular key):

  | handleKeys           | Behaviour                     |
  |--------------------- | ------------------------------|
  | true                 | VSCodeVim move page half down |
  | false                | remap to ```<D-d>```          |
  | undefined            | VS Code default behavior      |

  with `handleKeys` being configured like so:

  ```
  "vim.handleKeys": {
      "<C-d>": true,
  },
  ```
